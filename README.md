# Admin Autobot

Admin autobot is a simple application, which will automate the daily tasks of an operations engineer. The goal of this application is to nullify the effort spent in monitoring the servers for the Disk and CPU utilization across multiple servers. It will address these basic monitoring commands out of the box, and is extendable for other tasks if needed.


Autobot will connect to the machines defined, and executes the commands in regular intervals. It also logs the output and create reports out of these commands. In addition to the execution and reporting Autobot shows its awesomeness by monitoring these outputs and intimating the user groups if it crosses a threshold value.

Autobot is an application released under NoviceHacks.com domain. And is free to use in any environment.
